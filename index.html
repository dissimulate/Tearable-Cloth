It's been a couple of years since I made the original tearable cloth, and since then both me and Javscript have improved. I thought it deserved an update.

It should be more efficient, wall collisions are greatly improved, and it has a slightly more stretchy, cloth-like texture. The code is better, a bit smaller and now in ES2015.
